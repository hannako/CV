#Jessica Jones

I am a junior full stack developer, available for immediate start. I love clean code, being useful, and solving problems. I have an MSc in Science Media Production, a BSc in genetics and a shiny new GCSE in Astronomy. 

##About

Circa June 2016, I packed a successful 15-year career as a freelance TV producer onto a space probe destined for the outer solar system. I used to specialize in science, engineering and food shows (my very own niche) and worked for the BBC, C4, Discovery and National Geographic in London and New York City. 

##Skills 

###Drive
I am highly motivated, and unafraid of challenge. I completed the 12-week Maker’s Academy coding bootcamp as a remote student. This required discipline and focus – with a large helping of self-belief.

###Love of Learning
I have made shows (i.e. scripted, directed and interviewed experts) on varied complex topics; From quantum teleportation to the chemistry of Heston’s perfect steak. I have a well-honed ability to read, absorb and get up to speed with advanced topics fast. I am a fast and enthusiastic learner. 

###Attention to Detail
I am a fanatic fact checker. I have overseen 45 episode series, and had the opportunity to be a science consultant on a number of factual series. I am methodical and meticulous in my approach.


##Training

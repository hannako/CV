##Jessica Jones

I am a junior full stack developer, available for immediate start. I have an MSc in Science Media Production, a BSc in genetics and a shiny new GCSE in Astronomy. I was a freelance TV producer for 15 years, specializing in science, engineering and food shows for BBC1, BBC2, C4, ITV, Discovery and National Geographic. Earlier this year I made the exciting and liberating decision to turn from one type of programme making to another. Goodbye broadcast, Hello tech.  I love clean code, being useful, and solving problems. 

#Skills 

###Drive
I am highly motivated, and unafraid of challenge. I completed the 12-week Makers Academy coding bootcamp as a remote student. This required discipline and focus – with a large helping of self-belief.

###Love of Learning
I have made shows (i.e. scripted, directed and edited) to extremely tight deadlines, on varied complex topics; from quantum computers to teleportation (it's a thing). I have a well-honed ability to read, absorb and get up to speed with advanced topics fast. I am a quick and enthusiastic learner.

###Attention to Detail
I've discovered I enjoy refactoring and debugging code almost as much as I once enjoyed fact checking. I have consulted on a number of factual science programmes, and recently oversaw a flagship 45 episode series for the BBC2. I am methodical and meticulous in my approach, a skill I have found central to creating robust applications.

###Languages | Frameworks | Databases
Ruby, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Rails, SQL, ORMs: datamapper and activerecord

###Favourite things
Test Driven Development, using Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine.
Object Orientated Design.
Single Responsibility Principle.
Agile practices: daily stand-ups, retros, pair programming, and delivering MVPs with an incremental approach to feature addition.

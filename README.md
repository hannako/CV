# Jessica Jones

**Available for immediate start as a junior full stack developer**

Before learning to code I was a freelance TV producer, specialising in science, engineering and food shows for the BBC, C4, Discovery and National Geographic. Earlier this year I made the exciting decision to turn from one type of programme making to another. Goodbye broadcast...Hello tech.  I strive to write clean code, be useful, and solve problems.

## Personal Attributes

#### Drive
I am highly motivated, and unafraid of a challenge. I completed the 12-week [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com) coding bootcamp as a remote student. This required discipline and focus – with a large helping of self-belief.

#### Love of Learning and Feedback
I have made series (i.e. scripted, directed and edit produced) to extremely tight deadlines, on varied complex topics from quantum computers to teleportation. I have a well-honed ability to read, absorb and get up to speed with advanced topics fast. I am a quick and enthusiastic learner and respond well to feedback.

#### Communication
I am an excellent communicator and team member. I have 15 years experience of working in teams as a freelancer in a mainly freelance industry. When the team changes regularly the ability to communicate the big idea, its current status, and its unique challenges is a core skill.

#### Attention to Detail
I have consulted on a number of factual science programmes, and recently oversaw a flagship 45 episode series for BBC2. I am methodical and meticulous in my approach, a skill I have found central to learning to code.
